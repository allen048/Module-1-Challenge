Crowdfunding Homework Assignment

Written Report:
My first conclusion is that the Crowdfunding Campaign has a higher percentage of successful outcomes based on their goals. 
Second conclusion is it has a lower percentage of canceled outcomes for their goals. My final conclusion is that the theater/plays is a positive outlier for this analysis. 

Some limitations for this dataset include that it doesn’t have the most recent data for this analysis, as the data only covers information from 2010-2020.  
We’re limited to the backers count and can’t go deeper by each individual investor. Also, we need more data to determine how much each individual backer pledged.

My suggestions for creating a table or graph for this assignment is to develop a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by currency based on the 
category/outcome pivot table that you must create. Also we can develop a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by currency and parent category 
based on the sub-category/outcome pivot table you must create.

Statistical Analysis:
The median better summarizes this information. This collection of data has a skewed distribution and a central tendency. This representation does contain a 
significant outlier, theater/plays, which constitute as a median being the best approach to summarize this data.
